  <h1>System Calls in Operating Systems</h1>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">Introduction</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>A system call is a programmatic way for a computer program to request services from the operating system's kernel. It acts as an interface between user-level processes and the operating system, allowing programs to access system resources and perform privileged operations. System calls are the only entry points into the kernel and provide a standardized and reliable method for programs to interact with the underlying system. Without system calls, programs would need to implement their own methods for accessing resources, leading to inconsistency and potential errors.</p>
    </div>

  <h2>Process Control System Calls</h2>
  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">fork()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>fork()</code> system call creates a new process by duplicating the existing process. The new process, called the child process, is an identical copy of the original process, called the parent process. The child process has its own memory space but inherits the code, data, and file descriptors of the parent process. The system call take sthe address space of the parent process and makes a copy of it for the child process. The child process begins execution from the same point as the parent process i.e both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">exec()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>exec()</code> system call replaces the current process with a new process. It loads a new program into the current process's memory space and starts its execution. This allows running different programs without creating a separate process for each program. It replaces the current process with a new program and is used
        when a new program is to be executed, without creating a new process. It
        takes the pathname of the new program as argumnet, as well as the
        arguments of the new program. It does not return to the calling process but
        instead takes over the current process space. It helps improve
        performmance compared to fork() that spawns a new process.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">exit()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>exit()</code> system call is used to terminate a process in an operating
        system. This system call is used when a process is finished with its task, or
        when it needs to be terminated due to an error or abnormal condition. The
        exit() system call takes an integer argument which is used to indicate the
        exit status of the process. Once the exit() system call is called, the process
        is terminated and all of its resources are released. It flushes all unwritten
        buffered data, closes all opened files, removes temporary files and returns
        exit status to OS. This prevents any kind of memory leaks in the system. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">wait()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>wait()</code> system call  is used to synchronize the execution of processes
        within an operating system. This system call is used when a process needs
        to wait for the termination of one or more child processes before it can
        continue with its task. The wait() system call takes an integer pointer as an
        argument, which is used to store the exit status of the child process. Once
        the wait() system call is called, the calling process will wait until all of its
        child processes have terminated. The child process may be terminated via
        exit() call or return statement from main() function.The wait() system call is
        an important part of any operating system, as it allows processes to wait for
        the completion of other processes before continuing with their tasks.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <h2>File Management System Calls</h2>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">open()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>open()</code> opens a file if it already exists or creates a new if
        the file does not exist. It takes two parameters : the path to the file to be
        opened and a flag. The path acan be absolute or relative from the current
        working diretcory. The flag is an integer that indicates the mode in which the
        file is to be opened i.e read-only mode or write-only mode or read-write
        mode.It returns a file descriptor, which is a small integer that identifies the
        file to the calling process. This file descriptor can be used with other system
        calls like read, write, and close to read from or write to the file. It
        returns -1 upon failure.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">close()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>exec()</code> system call is used to close an open file descriptor. A file
        descriptor is a type of reference to an open file that is used by the operating
        system and applications to manipulate files. The close() system call is used
        to close an open file descriptor and release any associated resources. It
        also removes any record of the file descriptor from the system. This system
        call is important for ensuring that all file descriptors are closed correctly and
        resources are released properly. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">read()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>read()</code> system call allows a process to read data from an open file
        descriptor. The data can be read from the beginning of the file, end of file or
        from current position of the descriptor. The read() system call takes in three
        parameters : The file descriptor from which data is to be read, a pointer to a
        buffer where the data is to be stored and the maximum number of bytes to
        be read. The system call returns the number of bytes read or -1 in case of
        error. Read() is a blocking system call i.e if there is no data to be read, the
        callin gprocess will be blocked until data becomes available.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="system-call">
    <span class="call-name">write()</span>
    <div class="call-description">
      <p>The <code>write()</code> system call allows a process to write data onto an open file
        descriptor. The data can be written in the beginning of the file, end of file or
        from current position of the descriptor. The write() system call takes in three
        parameters : The file descriptor of the file onto which data is to be written, a
        pointer to the buffer that contains the data to be written and the number of
        bytes to be written from the buffer. </p>
